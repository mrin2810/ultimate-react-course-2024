# Effects and Data Fetching

## The Component(Instance) Lifecycle

- The lifecycle of a component is phases that an instance goes throught
- Phase 1: Mount/Initial Render - Component is born in the phase
- Phase 2: Re-render - It can re-render n number of times State changes, prop changes, parent rerenders and context changes
- Phase 3: UnMount - Component is destroyed and removed. State and Props are destroyed.

- We can hook into different lifecycle phases. We do this using the useEffect Hook.
