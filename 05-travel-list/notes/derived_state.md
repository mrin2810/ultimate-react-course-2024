# Deriving State

- Derived state is state which is computed form existing state, or props.
- If we have separate pieces of states, then, we need to keep them in sync all the time.
- And, these 3 states will cause 3 re-renders.
- Instead we can use derived states.
- We use consts, and not useStates.
- Updating the state, rerenders the component, which means, the function is called again, meaning everything stays in sync.
