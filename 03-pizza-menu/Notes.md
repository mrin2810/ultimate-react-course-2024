# Components

- React apps are always made from building blocks called as Components
- We should be able to reuse the apps
- We should be comfortable with using nested components
- Never nest, component declarations

# JSX

- JSX looks a lot like HTML.
- Babel converts the JSX to JavaScript.
- It will convert JSX to Pure React Code.
- This conversion is necessary, as browsers do not understand JSX, they only understand HTML.
- JSX makes it readable as well.
- It is Declarative syntax, meaning, we only tell what to render, but no imperative syntax(HOW) to achieve it!
