# Review the Section

- Components are building blocks
- Each component is self contained: Data, JS Logic, Appearance (JSX) - This describes what the user should see.
- We use style prop to style the components inline. JS block is inside {}.

- Components are in a tree structure. (parent child)
- Data is shared using props, we can pass data from parent to child. (BUT not from Child to Parent)
- List of Components using map method on an array.
- Conditional Rendering, we render components only when certain conditions are met. (&&, ? :, multiple return)
